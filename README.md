# Metasploit Framework: Network Reconnaissance using Nmap

This report details a network scan executed via the Metasploit Framework to perform a security assessment of a local machine. The objective was to utilize the `db_nmap` utility within Metasploit to identify open ports and running services, analyze the findings, and propose security recommendations based on the system's network posture.

[cite_start]This exercise serves as a practical demonstration of an initial reconnaissance phase from an attacker's perspective, conducted in a controlled, personal environment.

### üõ†Ô∏è Methodology and Execution

The assessment was performed in a Kali Linux environment. The Metasploit Framework was used as the primary platform to launch an Nmap scan against the local host.

**Execution Steps:**

1.  **Gained Root Privileges:**
    ```bash
    sudo su
    ```
2.  **Launched Metasploit Framework:**
    ```bash
    msfconsole
    ```
3.  **Identified Host IP Address:** The local IP `192.168.174.128` was identified using `ifconfig`.
4.  **Executed the Nmap Scan:** The scan was initiated from within the Metasploit console using the following command, which saves the results directly to the Metasploit database[cite: 565]:
    ```bash
    db_nmap -sC -sV -vv 192.168.174.128
    ```
    -   `-sC`: Run default Nmap scripts. 
    -   `-sV`: Enumerate service versions. 
    -   `-vv`: Enable verbose output for detailed analysis.

### üìä Findings and Analysis

The primary finding of the scan was that **all 1000 scanned ports were in a "closed" or "ignored" state**.

**Scan Output Snippet:**
```
[*] Nmap: All 1000 scanned ports on 192.168.174.128 are in ignored states. 
[*] Nmap: Not shown: 1000 closed tcp ports (reset) 
```

**Analysis:**
The absence of open ports indicates a strong initial network security posture, significantly reducing the risk of traditional network-based attacks. However, this does not imply the system is entirely secure.

An attacker faced with this result would likely pivot to other vectors, such as:
* Exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system or applications that do not rely on listening ports.
* Attempting social engineering or phishing attacks to gain initial access.
* Seeking physical access to the machine.

### üìú Recommendations

Based on the findings, recommendations focus on maintaining this strong defensive posture and implementing a defense-in-depth strategy.

* **Immediate Actions:**
    * **Verify Filtered Ports:** Immediately investigate why certain ports are "filtered" or "ignored" to ensure this is intentional.
    * **System Patching:** Ensure the OS and all installed applications are fully updated with the latest security patches to mitigate non-port-based exploits.

* **Long-Term Mitigation:**
    * **Implement Endpoint Security:** Deploy Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions to detect malicious activity that bypasses the network perimeter.
    * **Adopt Zero Trust:** Implement a Zero Trust security model where access is granted based on verified user and device identity, not network location.
    * **Enhance Monitoring:** Use Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems and File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) to detect anomalous behavior and unauthorized changes.
